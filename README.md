Description:
This website is intended for classmates and will be a to-do list where you can add friends and compete to see who is the most productive. Completeting tasks on time will earn you points and failing to complete a task by the deadline will result in points being deducted. It is important that users competing against eachother are working on the same tasks (for example assignments from the same class).
